# Coding Bootcamp Challenge 1 - Code Refactor by Isaac Fallon

## Description

This project is a code refractor task for the marketing agency, Horiseon. It serves as the week 1 challenge for The University of Sydney's Coding Bootcamp.

- The motivation for completing this project was to ensure that the codebase provided was cleaned up to be as accessible as possible for both future developers and users interacting with the page. 
- This project was completed in order to fix several accessibility problems with the codebase as it was provided. 
- The problem solved by refractoring the codebase in this way is that the page is now accessible for developers who may need to alter the codebase in the future and for users accessing the page, especially if they require the assistance of a page reader. 
- My biggest learning from completing this project was the importance of keeping other developers and the end user in mind when coding. By staying in this frame of mind of thinking about how others would use my work, it resulted in cleaner code that follows proper accessibility standards.

4. Navigate to the cloned folder and access webpage by either opening the index.html file in your browser of choice or opening the codebase in your code editor of choice and opening the index.html file in a live window. 

## Credits

My CSS codebase utilises a very small snippet of code found on a Stack Overflow answer [linked here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30553602/flexbox-justify-left-and-right-on-the-same-line) by user 'mmgross'. 

Screenshot of the answer sourced below:

The relevant code is used in my styles.css file on lines 28 and 38. 

The purpose of using this code was to ensure that the child elements with my header tag (h1 and nav) could use the same horizontal space but be aligned on opposite sides of the header space.
